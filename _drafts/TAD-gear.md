## Control panel 1

Modular and versatile

I bought this control panel to go inside my FAST Pack Scout, where it fits perfectly. 

Recently during a bit of regional air travel, I used the control panel 1 paired with a GPP1 and a drink bottle holder attached to the PALS on the back as my in-flight personal item. Headphones folded into the GPP1, iPad Pro 10.5" inside the centre slot and cables and a battery bank in the zippered pockets along with a snack or two. I looped the attachment webbing back over to form a top handle, and the whole thing fit in the pocket below the tray table. To perfect this loadout I plan to add a booster pod in the remaining gap for the sunglasses.

With the webbing on one side and the mesh pocket on the other, this control panel is so versatile that the imaginable uses are infinite. Some other examples I've used are keeping an EDC kit to transfer from bag to bag to car to where ever; adding organisation to a bag with only one pocket of its own; turning my Scout pack from EDC to laptop bag and back without the hassle of a major unpacking; using as a stand-alone bag for an iPad when I only need a small carry.

## General Purpose Pouch 1

General purpose = multi purpose

I once searched in vain for the ultimate admin pouch. I bought and tried several after reading dozens of reviews and product descriptions. But when I bought the GPP1 I realised that the ultimate admin pouch is too specialised to be properly useful. With the GPP1, the beauty is in the versatility. It can be an admin pouch and carry notebook, pen, knife, torch, tape, cord and lighter. Or it can just as easily and effectively be a med pouch, a headphone pouch, a snack pouch, a tech and cable pouch. It's not so big that attaching to to PALS webbing ends up looking like an odd growth on your bag, nor is it so small that you can't, say, shove a pair of work gloves in there if you need to. I think I'll stop searching for the ultimate admin pouch.

## Topo Shemagh

Work, play, adventure

The topo skull shemagh is the softest, most stylish shemagh I have found. Then again, my others are mostly cheap ones from the surplus store. I really like that the design is subtle but even if you can't see the central image most people who are familiar with the outdoors will recognise the topo lines pattern. I got a darkish colour so I can wear it to work, out on a cool evening or adventuring in hot or cold weather. I think I'll probably get a second one! (edit: I did get a second one)

## FAST Pack Scout

Quick Scout story of the day

This one's just a quick story of today's Scout pack adventure. I'll do a full review of this bag at some point.

A day off work means a better dog walk day. Today was a calm, mild and slightly rainy day, so the best Buddy and I headed off around the bays knowing we would have the place mostly to ourselves. He enjoys the smells, I enjoy the views. The Scout pack enjoys carrying my stuff: EDC items live in the front pocket plus I had a small tool kit in there from a previous outing. First aid kit, water bottle, snack, Buff, gloves, responsible-dog-owner bags, treats. The hound was happy to get the longer walk and I was happy to carry whatever I probably wouldn't need. There was space for the rain shell in there too, and I just about could have taken it off (but didn't).
